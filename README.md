# MoStudioDocs
This is a public repository hosting documentation for *Motorica Studio* (*MoStudio* for short). A Wiki-style knowledge base is favored over using Google Docs (yikes!) and will be populated with content overtime.

For now, here are some useful links:
- [Motorica website](https://www.motorica.ai/)
- [Motorica Studio user guide (Google Docs)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSEqmBBs6cngvLE4BB4AVtasH601Gsfe5rLUPssLbWOacWo-mXegOY53pn8IZxsUS6O7KsMPtELplIy/pub)
