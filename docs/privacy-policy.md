Motorica Studio does not collect any data from you interactions with the plugin or Unreal Engine.

It only transfers account data (email, password, authentication token) to authenticate you with Motorica's servers and to give you access to its cloud-based tools. The plugin also sends animation data in order to generate animations on the cloud, which then get sent back to Unreal Engine for visualisation.
