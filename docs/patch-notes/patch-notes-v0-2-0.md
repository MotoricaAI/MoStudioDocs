## Additional notes
- New retargeting assets have been added to the plugin. The old `IK Rig` asset "IK_Motorica", that came with *Motorica Studio v0.1.0*, is deprecated and the new `Plugin > Content > Retargeting > MotoricaStudio > IK_MoStudio_minimal` should be used instead. If you are using the old IK Rig asset, point your references to `Plugin > Content > Retargeting > MotoricaStudio > IK_MoStudio_legacy`.
