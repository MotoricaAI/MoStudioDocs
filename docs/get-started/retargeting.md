# Retargeting

A detailed guide on how to do retargeting is currently unavailable. For now, you are encouraged to explore the included [retargeting assets](../get-started/included-assets.md#retargeting) in the Content Browser yourself. Open them to see how retargeting is configured, specifically the `IK Rig` and `IK Retargeter` assets.

You can also refer to these YouTube tutorials for more information:

!!! warning
    Retargeting in UE 5.0 is not ideal. You are encouraged to use UE 5.1 and above.
