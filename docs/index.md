# Introduction

Welcome to the documentation website for Motorica Studio!

We are slowly transitioning from the original Google Docs style of documentation (e.g. the [user guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSEqmBBs6cngvLE4BB4AVtasH601Gsfe5rLUPssLbWOacWo-mXegOY53pn8IZxsUS6O7KsMPtELplIy/pub)) to a more maintanable and user-friendly one. As such, the website is currently rather barebones. Your patience is appreciated as the docs are populated over time.

We expect to do something similar for the [plugin binary releases](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1e6sxkr8GiZCXNJb9W0bH32bwcNw06wqm), which are currently hosted on Google Cloud.
